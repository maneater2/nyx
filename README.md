# üöÄ Installation 

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Use this configuration at your own risk! ‚ö†Ô∏è** <br>
> Applying custom configurations, especially those related to your operating system, can have unexpected consequences and may interfere with your system's normal behavior. While I have tested these configurations on my own setup, there is no guarantee that they will work flawlessly on all systems. <br>
> **I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using this configuration.**

> It is highly recommended to review the configuration contents and make necessary modifications to customize it to your needs before attempting the installation.

1. **Install NixOs**

   First install nixos using any [graphical ISO image](https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso). 

2. **Clone the repo**

   ```
   nix-shell -p git
   git clone https://github.com/maneater2/nyx
   cd nyx
   ```
3. **Install script**

   > First make sure to read the install script, it isn't long
   
   Execute and follow the installation script :
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
   > You will need to change the git account yourself in ./modules/home/git.nix
   ```
      programs.git = {
         ...
         userName = "[user here]";
         userEmail = "[email here]";
         ...
      };
   ```
4. **Reboot**

   After rebooting, you'll be greeted by swaylock prompting for your password, with the wallpaper in the background.

5. **Manual config**

   Even though I use home manager, there is still a little bit of manual configuration to do:
      - Set Aseprite theme (they are in the folder `./nyx/modules/home/aseprite/themes`).
      - Enable Discord theme (in Discord settings under VENCORD > Themes).
      - Configure the browser (for now, all browser configuration is done manually).

### Install script walkthrough

A brief walkthrough of what the install script does.

1. **Get username**

   You will receive a prompt to enter your username, with a confirmation check.

2. **Set username**

   The script will replace all occurancies of the default usename ```CURRENT_USERNAME``` by the given one stored in ```$username```

3. Create basic directories

   The following directories will be created:
   - ```~/Music```
   - ```~/Documents```
   - ```~/Pictures/wallpapers/others```

4. Copy the wallpapers

   Then the wallpapers will be copied into ```~/Pictures/wallpapers/others``` which is the folder in which the ```wallpaper-picker.sh``` script will be looking for them.

5. Get the hardware configuration

   It will also automatically copy the hardware configuration from ```/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix``` to ```./hosts/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix``` so that the hardware configuration used is yours and not the default one.

6. Choose a host (desktop / laptop)

   Now you will need to choose the host you want. It depend on whether you are using a desktop or laptop.

7. Build the system

   Lastly, it will build the system, which includes both the flake config and home-manager config.
